"""
Coding agents state classes and checkpoint persistence.

Resume applies `checkpoint.ManifestSnapshot`: the per-file divergence of the
workspace from the tree the entrypoint installed, replayed as CONTENT. Nothing
is re-executed.

This environment used to rebuild its workspace by re-running every recorded
shell command. That was never sound. Re-running `pip install`, `git commit` and
the agent's own test invocations is not a restore, it is a second, differently
timed run: commands that failed the first time could succeed now (and vice
versa), a command whose output the agent had already read could change what it
would read, and anything the agent wrote by a route that does not replay — an
editor, a background process, a command that timed out — simply vanished. The
mypy pre-commit hook this task is about is a file the agent writes into
.git/hooks and then exercises; a resume that re-ran the agent's commands could
easily produce a hook, a git history and a working tree that never coexisted.
